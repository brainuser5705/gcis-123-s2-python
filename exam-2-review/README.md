You are given a list of numbers in a file called `numbers.txt`.  

Your task is to
- Pick out all numbers $\ge$ 0 and has $\ge$ 2 digits and place them in sorted order in an list.
- Then using **recursion**, print their word form *(ex: 10 is "one zero", 256 is "two five six")*. 
*Note: Your algorithm must be of time complexity `O(n)`.*

Additional tasks:
- You must do test driven development with unit testing for every function you create.   
*Note: 1 test will suffice given the time constraint, you do not need to test your sorting function*
- Your implementation must be able to handle any possible errors with an appropiate error message.
- Add docstrings.
