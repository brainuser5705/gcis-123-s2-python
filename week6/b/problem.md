**Create a email/password validator that**   

- accepts passwords that:

    - are 8 characters
    - Begins with a number or a lowercase letter
    - Contains at least two capital letters in a row
    - Contains at least one non-alphanumeric character

and rejects otherwise. 

**Parse through a csv file for valid passwords and print out the names and emails of the users.**

---

Plan:
- Create test functions with TDD for the reg expressions
- Make the regular expression for the email and password
- Create test functions for the csv parsing
Make the parsing function
